# The reasonable effectiveness of Julia

description will follow soon

## TODO

- copy contents from previous repo location
- fix Dockerfile: 
  + try to install `stack` as early as possible to reuse stage
  + install Julia LTS instead of 1.9
  + fix config such that VS Code and the browser can access Jupyter Lab
  + then get sample codes running
